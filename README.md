### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eric!

For most of my life so far, I've spent it exploring and learning about new technologies. As a young boy I always enjoyed creating and building, so I paired these two ideologies together when I decided to pursue a career in the field of technology. Initially I thought Electrical Engineering would be my passion, as I really enjoyed building circuits and learning about logic gates. But once I took an introductory programming course, I soon discovered that I enjoyed programming much more, and also had a knack for it. Through college courses learning Java and C#, working as a developer for a year learning JavaScript and React, and now having finally gone through App Academy's 24-week software engineering program. I am ready to fully immerse myself into the field of Software Development.
